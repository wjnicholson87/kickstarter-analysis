## Overview of Project

### Purpose
-Analize a set of kickstarter data in order to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The main challenges were removing excess data from the set that did not pertain to theater outcomes. There were many outliers from other forms of media that skewed data and made analysis more difficulty. In addition the outliers interfered with conditional formating in such a way that percentiles limits had to be set in order to visualize outcomes. 
## Results

  When we observe the table titled "Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date", we can clearly see that May is the month in which most successful kickstarter campagins launch. Another thing seen here is that both October and December are bad months to launch a campagin. In these months we see, not only a peak in failed campagins, but also an almost equal amount of failed and successful campagins.  

Considering the results from the outcomes comparison table becomes more difficult. What is seen here is the dollar amount in which campagins are successful and the amounts that lead to failure. The proposed $10,000 budget may compromise the goal. Plays with a similar budget had an almost equal chance to fail or succeed. It is recomended that a budget that does not exced $5000 is considered do to a 20% chance increase in success. Budgets within the $35,000 - $45,000 range also have increased chance to succeed.  

This data can be narrow and limited when considering just the outcomes of plays. Including other forms of theater may reduce variance and improve analysis. The data set is also a limited time line with the last data being from 2017. More recent data or data from a larger range of time may improve results. It might also be ideal to consider different visuals or pivot tables that consider outcomes of media with a budget of $10,000. A pie chart with all of the different theater sub catorgories that share a similar budget would be ideal.
